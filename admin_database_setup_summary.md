# Admin Database Setup Summary

## Task 1: Set up admin database schema and security policies

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

#### 1. Admin-Specific Database Tables Created

**admin_audit_log**
- Comprehensive audit trail for all admin actions
- Tracks action type, resource type, old/new values
- Includes IP address, user agent, and session tracking
- Indexed for performance on admin_id, created_at, action_type, resource_type

**system_alerts**
- System-wide alerts and notifications
- Severity levels: low, medium, high, critical
- Resolution tracking with admin assignment
- Metadata storage for additional context
- Indexed on severity, resolution status, and creation date

**user_suspensions**
- User suspension management with full audit trail
- Tracks suspension reason, admin who suspended, and lift details
- Active suspension tracking with boolean flag
- Indexed on user_id, active status, and suspension date

**content_moderation**
- Content moderation and flagging system
- Supports multiple content types (events, messages, etc.)
- Automated and manual moderation workflow
- Status tracking: pending, approved, rejected, flagged
- Indexed on content_type, status, and creation date

#### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Implemented

- **Admin-only access**: All admin tables restricted to users with admin role
- **Secure helper function**: `is_admin()` function to verify admin privileges
- **Comprehensive policies**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for all tables
- **Audit trail protection**: Admin audit logs are insert-only for admins

#### 3. Database Views for Admin Data Aggregation

**admin_user_overview**
- Comprehensive user data with suspension status
- Event and guest counts per user
- Subscription status and activity metrics
- Storage usage tracking
- 30-day activity indicators

**admin_system_metrics**
- Real-time system health overview
- User growth and activity metrics
- Event and guest statistics
- Subscription conversion metrics
- Critical alerts and pending moderation counts
- Storage usage aggregation

#### 4. RPC Functions for Admin Operations

**get_user_activity(user_uuid)**
- Detailed user activity history across all system components
- Event creation, guest management, email activities, file uploads
- Chronologically ordered activity timeline
- Admin-only access with proper authorization checks

**admin_suspend_user(user_uuid, reason, admin_uuid)**
- Secure user suspension with comprehensive audit trail
- Prevents duplicate suspensions
- Automatic audit log entry creation
- Admin authorization verification

**admin_reactivate_user(user_uuid, admin_uuid)**
- User reactivation with audit trail
- Updates suspension records with lift details
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Admin authorization verification

**get_system_health_metrics()**
- Real-time system health indicators
- Database connection monitoring
- Response time tracking (via email delivery proxy)
- Error rate calculation
- Storage usage percentage
- Health status categorization (healthy/warning/critical)

#### 5. Security Features Implemented

- **Multi-layer authorization**: RLS policies + function-level checks
- **Audit trail immutability**: Comprehensive logging of all admin actions
- **Role-based access**: Integration with existing RBAC system
- **Secure function execution**: SECURITY DEFINER with proper authorization
- **IP and session tracking**: Full context capture for audit purposes

#### 6. Performance Optimizations

- **Strategic indexing**: All frequently queried columns indexed
- **Efficient joins**: Views optimized for common admin queries
- **Proper data types**: Appropriate column types for performance
- **Query optimization**: Efficient aggregation in system metrics view

### üìÅ Migration File Location

The complete database schema is available in:
`supabase/migrations/20250716000000_admin_space_integration.sql`

### üîß Manual Application Required

Due to authentication issues with the Supabase CLI, the migration needs to be applied manually:

1. **Option 1: Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dirrpadiqtuesgerawmq/sql
   - Copy and paste the contents of the migration file
   - Execute the SQL

2. **Option 2: Database Direct Connection**
   - Connect to the database using a PostgreSQL client
   - Execute the migration file contents

### ‚úÖ Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 5.1**: ‚úÖ Security monitoring and audit trails implemented
- **Requirement 5.2**: ‚úÖ Admin action logging with comprehensive audit trail
- **Requirement 5.3**: ‚úÖ Searchable, filterable audit logs with proper indexing
- **Requirement 5.5**: ‚úÖ Compliance reporting capabilities through audit views

### üîÑ Next Steps

1. Apply the migration file to the database
2. Verify all tables, views, and functions are created successfully
3. Test admin role assignment and access controls
4. Proceed to Task 2: Extend authentication system with admin-specific features

### üß™ Testing Verification

After applying the migration, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('admin_audit_log', 'system_alerts', 'user_suspensions', 'content_moderation');

-- Check views exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('admin_user_overview', 'admin_system_metrics');

-- Check functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN ('get_user_activity', 'admin_suspend_user', 'admin_reactivate_user', 'get_system_health_metrics');

-- Test admin role check
SELECT is_admin();
```
